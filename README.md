# Generative Orbit / [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeocE6bLczE)

I'm always trying new approaches to generating Solar Systems, and I really like the way this one looks. Also, this is just a simple Python version of an interactive one I made with P5.js. You can try out that version with the link below.

If you want to run this Python version, make sure to download [Processing](https://www.processing.org) and use the Python module. Reach out to thebuffed@gmail.com if you have any questions.
